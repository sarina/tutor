- ðŸ’¥[Feature] Upgrade to Palm. (by @regisb)
    - [Bugfix] Rename ORA2 file upload folder from "SET-ME-PLEASE (ex. bucket-name)" to "openedxuploads". This has the effect of moving the corresponding folder from the `<tutor root>/data/lms/ora2` directory. MinIO users were not affected by this bug.
    - ðŸ’¥[Improvement] During registration, the honor code and terms of service links are no longer visible by default. For most platforms, these links did not work anyway. (by @regisb)
